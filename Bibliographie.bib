	Abstract = {Background: Energy management has a vital impact on success of virtualization. Power consumption and generation of heat play critical roles in the core concept of energy management. Presently, energy consumption is continuously growing due to high usage of system resources and rising of demand in computer density. The high power usage and high heat generation lead to instabilities of their hardware systems and cause system reboot more often. Materials and Methods: To avoid above malfunctions and save from permanent damage to the system resources, this study are investigated and tested the power consumption and heat generation during the usage of low-level performance application, online education application and high-level performance application, respectively via the implementation of XEN, KVM and Docker virtualization technologies in between static and dynamic modes. Results: The result proved the power consumption and heat generation is higher for hypervisor-based virtualization an},
